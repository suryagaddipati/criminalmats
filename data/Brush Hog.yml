  similar to that used on outdoor athletic fields. The tufted surface is designed\r\n
  \                                   to filter dirt and moisture away from the traffic
  surface to prevent it from entering\r\n                                    the building,
  while providing a safe walking surface. Available in four striking\r\n                                    colors,
  the BrushHog's non-skid rubber backing contains 20% recycled rubber content.\r\n
  \                                   They are certified slip-resistant by the National
  Floor Safety Institute.</p>\r\n                            </td>"

- 1. Vacuum Daily
- ! "Interior mats are constructed with either nylon or olefin surfaces designed to
  wipe residual soil, dust and moisture from shoes.  \r\n                                             They
  are most effective when used in conjunction with high performance entrance mats.
  \ \r\n                                             They should be vacuumed daily
  using either a dry or wet/dry vacuum."
- 2. Routine Maintenance
- ! "As needed, interior mats should be cleaned and/or spot cleaned using a neutral
  cleaner followed by rinsing.  \r\n                                           If
  the mat becomes wet during the cleaning process, it should be allowed to dry thoroughly
  before returning to service.  \r\n                                           Nylon
  mats will require a longer drying period and should be positioned where they can
  drain during the drying process."
- 3. Deep Cleaning
- ! "Interior mats can be deep cleaned using any method used for carpeted floors.
  \ \r\n                                             Andersen recommends using a neutral,
  solvent free cleaner if possible.  \r\n                                             In
  the event a solvent is used for removing oil, grease, or gum type spots, take care
  to thoroughly rinse the solvent \r\n                                             from
  the mat before it is allowed to dry for return to service."
- 4. Floor Preparation
- ! "As with entrance mats, prior to the mat being put back into service, Andersen
  recommends that the floor where \r\n                                             the
  mat will be placed be cleaned to remove dust and dirt.  This will allow the mat
  to grip the floor more \r\n                                             effectively
  reducing mat movement with traffic."

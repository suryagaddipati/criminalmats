  washable all-rubber mats stop dirt in its tracks! The SuperScrape traps tough dirt
  and grime outside the door, before \r\n                                    it enters
  the building. The specialized molded rubber tread pattern is slip resistant and
  provides anti-fatigue properties. \r\n                                    Constructed
  of extra heavy rubber, the SuperScrape stays in place. Available in either a 100%
  Nitrile Rubber version \r\n                                    (oil and grease resistant)
  or a Natural Rubber version.\r\n                                </p>\r\n                                <p>\r\n
